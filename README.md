## Technologies Used

<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px;">

- ``ros_arduino_bridge``: Turns an Arduino into a motor controller! It provides a simple serial interface to communicate with a high-level computer running ROS, and generates the appropriate PWM signals for a motor driver, to drive two motors.
- ``ROS 2 Humble``: The Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 Humble Hawksbill, a flexible framework for writing robot software.
- `Gazebo`: A powerful robot simulation tool that allows for testing and development in a simulated environment.
- `SLAM Toolkit`: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) toolkit used for mapping and navigation.
- `Nav 2`: The Navigation 2 stack in ROS 2, used for autonomous navigation of robots.
- `OpenCV`: Open Source Computer Vision Library, used for image processing and computer vision tasks.
- `Rviz2`: A 3D visualization tool for ROS 2, used to visualize the state of the robot and its environment.

The assests used for the simulation world (racks , boxes etc) is from an open source platform called AWS Robomaker . The world is a custom , developed by us .
